    "In the digital age, password security is paramount. As cyber threats evolve, understanding and reinforcing the strength of passwords becomes essential. This project aims to tackle this challenge using a data-driven approach. We leverage the \"Password Strength Classifier\" dataset from Kaggle, which offers a diverse set of passwords labeled by their strength. Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies passwords into categories of strength - weak, medium, or strong. This classification not only enhances our understanding of what constitutes a secure password but also serves as a tool for encouraging stronger cybersecurity practices. Post model development, we plan to deploy our solution using Streamlit, making it accessible and user-friendly. This project is not just about building a model; it's about contributing to safer digital environments.\n",
